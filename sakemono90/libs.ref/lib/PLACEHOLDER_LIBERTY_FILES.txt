# TODO: Liberty timing files need to be created
# This directory should contain the .lib files with timing characterization
# for all standard cells across different process corners.
#
# Required files for tape-out:
# - sakemono90_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib (typical corner)
# - sakemono90_fd_sc_hd__ff_n40C_1v95.lib (fast corner) 
# - sakemono90_fd_sc_hd__ss_100C_1v62.lib (slow corner)
#
# Optional additional corners:
# - sakemono90_fd_sc_hd__ff_100C_1v95.lib (fast-hot)
# - sakemono90_fd_sc_hd__ss_n40C_1v62.lib (slow-cold)
#
# Each .lib file contains:
# - Cell timing arcs (setup, hold, propagation delays)
# - Power consumption data
# - Input capacitance values
# - Output drive strength
# - Noise margins
# - Operating conditions (voltage, temperature)
#
# These files are typically generated by:
# 1. SPICE simulation across process corners
# 2. Characterization tools like Synopsys SiliconSmart
# 3. Foundry-provided characterization flows
#
# Liberty format specifications:
# - Each cell has timing tables for different load/slew combinations
# - Multiple timing arcs per cell (input to output paths)
# - Power tables for dynamic and leakage power
# - Environmental constraints and operating conditions
